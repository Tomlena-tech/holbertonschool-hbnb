## Edge Cases Tested

### Successful Cases
1. **Valid Data Creation**: All entities can be created with valid data
2. **Retrieval Operations**: All GET endpoints return correct data
3. **Update Operations**: All PUT endpoints update data correctly
4. **Delete Operations**: Reviews can be deleted successfully
5. **Relationship Handling**: Place includes owner and amenities, reviews linked to users and places

### Error Handling Cases
1. **Duplicate Email**: System properly rejects duplicate user emails (400 error)
2. **Non-existent Resources**: System returns 404 for non-existent users, places, and reviews
3. **Invalid Relationships**: System returns 400 when creating places with non-existent owners
4. **Invalid Relationships**: System returns 400 when creating reviews with non-existent users/places

## Swagger Documentation
Swagger documentation is automatically generated by Flask-RESTX and available at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/
```
**User creation:**

</div>

**User duplicate email error:**
<div align="center">
   <img src="/hbnb/images/swagger_user_duplicate_email.png" alt="Swagger User Duplicate Email" width="300px">
</div>

The documentation accurately reflects:
- All endpoint routes
- Request/response models
- Expected status codes
- Required/optional fields
- Data types and validation rules

## Manual Testing with cURL

### Example: Create User
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }'
```
**Expected Response:** 201 Created with user object

### Example: Invalid User Data
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "",
    "last_name": "",
    "email": "invalid-email"
  }'
```
**Expected Response:** 400 Bad Request with error message

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Email Uniqueness Tracking
**Problem:** User model tracks emails globally in a set that persists across tests  
**Solution:** Added `setUpClass` method to clear the email set before each test class runs  
**Status:** Resolved

### Issue 2: Timestamp-based Unique Emails
**Problem:** Tests needed unique emails to avoid conflicts  
**Solution:** Implemented timestamp-based email generation for each test  
**Status:** Resolved

## Conclusions

### Summary
All 21 automated tests passed successfully, demonstrating that:
1. All CRUD operations work correctly for all entities
2. Validation is properly implemented at the model level
3. Error handling returns appropriate status codes
4. Relationships between entities are correctly maintained
5. The DELETE operation works specifically for reviews

### Recommendations
1. ✓ All basic validations are in place and working
2. ✓ Error handling is comprehensive and consistent
3. ✓ API follows RESTful principles
4. ✓ Documentation is accurate and complete
